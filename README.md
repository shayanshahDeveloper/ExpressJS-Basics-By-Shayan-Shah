* Basic Routing: Setting up initial routes to handle different HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) and defining paths.
* String Patterns and Regex: Using patterns to define routes more flexibly, which is useful for handling complex URL structures.
* Multiple Routing and Callbacks: Demonstrating how multiple functions can handle a single route, often used for chaining middlewares.
* Double Callbacks: Setting up multiple callback functions that allow more modular code and improve error handling.
* Route Parameters and String Queries: Dynamically handling data in URLs, such as /user/:id or query strings like ?name=John.
* Middleware: Implementing functions that execute during the lifecycle of a request, such as logging, authentication, or validation.
* Controllers: Separating route logic into controllers to keep code modular and maintainable.
* express.static: Serving static files, like images or CSS, directly to the client.
* EJS Templates: Using EJS as a templating engine to render dynamic HTML pages.
